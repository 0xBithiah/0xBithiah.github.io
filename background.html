<h2>Summary of the time I've been on this Earth</h2>
<br>
<p><b>Work:</b> Previously at <a href="https://marketmapper.io/">Market Mapper</a>, Mozilla, Internet Archive. Right now I'm working full-time breaking things at a TLV based blockchain security startup and doing really cool work!</p>
<br>
<p><b>Projects/Open-Source:</b> I love to contribute to projects I have used/use and believe in its potential. Currently contributing to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> as a mapper and updating the geospatial databases. I also did other things such as the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Support/TCP-ETP">TCP/ETP project at Mozilla</a>.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Education:</b> In 11th grade and attend <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/k12/">TTU K-12</a>. Coursework includes Computer Science 1A/1B & 2A/2B, Mathematical Economics, Forestry and Woodland Ecosystems, Business and Industry track.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Sports:</b> 99% of all Aussies have done a lot of sports when they were younger whether it be AFL or swimming or tennis. Two sports have influenced me heavily with both having done at a competitive level: Fencing (foil) and cross-country (2km, 3km) & track (800m, 1500m).
<p>When I was 9, I won my first 2km cross-country event at school. This led me to do a lot of cross-country and track events. Progessed to EMR finals (regionals) for 3km, 800m, 1500m for three consecutive years (from 10 - 12).</p>
<p>I started fencing when I was 10 and started competing at state level. 2020 was a big year as I got 2 national medals at the Australian Junior Champs, silver (Women's Sabre Team) and bronze (Women's Foil Team). Having been a member of 3 fencing clubs over a span of 6 years, <a href="https://www.melbournefencingclub.com.au/">Melbourne Fencing Centre</a> is the best!</p> 
<br>
<h2>How did I get into tech?</h2>
<br>
<p>Hahahaha, now this is really funny and I get this question a lot. I hated programming all my life and still "hate it" but it's getting better. I suck at it, simple as that. Tried programming an EV3 at a young age, failed. Tried informatics olympiads and competitive programming in grade 8 - 10, failed.</p>
<p>Literally the epitome of failure in programming. </p>
<p>But something hit differently with cybersecurity, it just oddly did something to my head when I found there was a silly thing got CTF.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I feel very old to have started doing CTFs at 15 since so many guys I know have done CTFs since middle school and are great at the challs. Nevertheless everything requires hardwork and practice. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Major Timeline:</b></p>
<p>Wrote Hello World! at eight years old. </p>
<p>Coding EV3 robot throughout primary school years but took 0 interest. </p>
<p>Did competitive programming from 13 to 14 years old. </p>
<p>Got first Google swe interview at 14 (was a pure fluke btw).</p> 
<p>First CTF at 15. Got silly HackerOne vulnerability disclosure program invites.</p>
<p>Internship at 16 (to all my American friends, I can't believe how you did 3 - 4 interships already)</p>
<p>My first full-time job at 16 doing extremely challenging yet fun work.</p>
