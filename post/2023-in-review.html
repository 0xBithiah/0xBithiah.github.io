    <p>Happy new year once again! I'm not sure I'll manage to say anything positive about this
year, so I'll try to keep things brief.</p>
<h2>State of the Site</h2>
<p>Well, it still exists and that's more than you could say about a lot of the Lainchan-adjacent 
blogs from ~2018-2022 lol. I've been neglecting posting again this year, but
not really out of laziness or forgetfulness. I've just not had anything to talk about
and have not been working on anything interesting. In any case, I'm not planning on
going anywhere so in one way or another I'll be here and inevitably more posts will
come. Please keep emailing and leaving guestbook signatures as you desire, because
I always enjoy hearing from people. It's a great reminder that this corner of the
Internet isn't completely dead.</p>
<h2>Personal Goals</h2>
<p>All I can do is keep moving forward: continue with my C studies and start getting
more into projects and move on from the theory heavy textbooks. I want 2023 to
be the year of projects for me (however, not sure what will be associated with what
alias... more on that another time maybe).</p>
<p>In the last year I'd say I learned the C language in a primitive sense, but now I want
to focus on how to turn primitives into projects. Program design out of such simple
logic is not really a skill that crosses over from the Python scripting which my
experience has been limited prior to learning C. On that note, the more I learn C
and appreciate muh Unix philosophy, the more I dislike Python and the entire
scripting language philosophy. It's so tiring to be bogged down in Python dependencies
for things that should be proper programs and not hacked together scripts. This feeling
has led me to start looking more into minimalism-focused distros such as Kiss Linux,
but I haven't made any switch quite yet.</p>
<p>I still need to remember to update my
<a href="/node/path-to-competence/">Path to Competence</a>
learning log, because it's quite out of date now. I also haven't finished Advent of Code
yet this year. I still have a lot of fun doing the puzzles at midnight with /g/, but this
year it felt a bit different. I was wondering how the puzzles could have gotten easier
despite the <a href="https://www.maurits.vdschee.nl/scatterplot/">data</a>
suggesting the difficulty is on par with the last year or two. My
<span class="spoiler">baseless</span> theory is that the puzzles were easier, but
more tedious. That is, less prerequisite skill was required, but many of the problems
were made up of a lot of intricate steps (e.g. the simulation problems) that were
easy to screw up by not paying very close attention. The fact that I was able to
do most of the problems suggests this too, because I'm not sure I got any better
at this sort of thing in the last year lol. But I suppose that's another goal that I
will return for 2023: I want to be able to do the AoC puzzles in a few hours so they
don't end up fucking up my sleep schedule for an entire month and compromise
my ability to do anything else.</p>
<p>I have many other personal goals, but those are probably not worth spilling here.
But at the very least I need to find <em>some</em> way to pull myself together in 2023.</p>
<h2>Seasonal Anime I Watched</h2>
<p>I don't know if there's any reason to go through all of the shows I watched in
2022 like I did last year, but I'll at least mention that my favorite of them was probably
Bocchi the Rock. It also had the worst threads I've ever seen on /a/ and the
amount of newfags it's spawned is mind numbing. Not to sound overly egotistical
<span class="spoiler">but it's my own blogspam rant, who cares?</span> but
I've been feeling displaced in the communities I enjoy because of the
influx of irony-poisoned (presumably) teenagers that have been taking over every
site they touch with their pseudo chatroom-style discourse. Am I getting old or does the
Internet just move so quickly that it makes people feel disproportionately old?</p>
<p>Anyway, I still look forward to watching more comfy shows in the new year and will
continue to suffer through the ebb and flow because anything else would be quitter
mindset. Most importantly, never forget:</p>

<p>Anyway, back to getting drunk and listening to r/a/dio. KANPAI! Here's to
2023!</p>
