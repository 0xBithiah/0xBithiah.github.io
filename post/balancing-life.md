    <p>Here I will outline the tools and workflow that I've found works best for
me. I'm always interested in other people's setups, so I thought I would offer mine as
well. I will update this page over time sharing any changes.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I've used <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> since the start
  of my use of Linux as a whole and have no intentions of using anything else
  as my primary OS for the foreseeable future. I benefit the most from
  workspaces that are as free of clutter as possible, and Arch Linux offers an
  excellent balance of minimalism and sanity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My window manager is <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3wm</a>, because it's what
  I was initially drawn to and has never let me down since. I pair it with
  <a href="https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status">py3status</a> for the ability
  to use and write custom status bar scripts. To simplify window switching, I
  also use the
  <a href="https://github.com/cornerman/i3-easyfocus">i3-easyfocus</a> script.
  There are lighter weight WMs out there worth checking out, but I don't have
  the desire to change currently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/urxvt">URxvt</a> terminal
  emulator with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a> shell.
  I use the vi editing mode for Bash so that even my command line has
  familiar keybinds. I use <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> for
  terminal multiplexing, which is a vital task for my workflow. The
  <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/">fzf</a> fuzzy finder
  is another tool I make considerable use of on the command line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For text editing I prefer <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> with many
  plugins that each contribute to creating a fluid workflow that works for me.
  I really like my screen to be free of bullshit and interactions to be simple,
  logical keyboard mappings. I use
  <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org/">nano</a> when I want something more
  simple, but this is not very often at all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/media/2020-12-09_scrot.png"><img src="/media/2020-12-09_scrot.png" alt="vim setup" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger/">ranger</a> file browser is
  one of my most used programs, and I greatly appreciate it's contribution to
  my desire of fluidity and motion in program design. It uses familiar Vim-like
  keybinds, and has nice shell integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.musicpd.org/">mpd</a> with the
  <a href="https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp">ncmpcpp</a> front-end for my
  music. In the future I would like to set up a server that each of my devices
  can connect to and share the same back-end. I would be curious to try other
  mpd front-ends, but for now ncmpcpp  doesn't give me much to complain about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For PDF viewing I use 
  <a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/">Zathura</a> and it's made me
  question how I've ever used anything else (previously MuPDF).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a> is my video player, and
  <a href="https://github.com/muennich/sxiv">sxiv</a> is my photo viewer.
  Both "just work".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use the <a href="https://weechat.org/">Weechat</a> IRC client. Weechat
  supports a plugin system that can enable its simultaneous use for other
  protocols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> and
  occasionally <a href="https://invisible-island.net/lynx/">Lynx</a> are what
  I use for web browsing, but every browser seems to annoy me nearly equally.
  For Firefox I use an add-on that provides Vim-like keybinds for page
  navigation, and various other, likely redundant, privacy add-ons. Read 
  <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/firefox.html">this</a> for
  advice on how to secure your browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rakshasa.github.io/rtorrent/">rtorrent</a> is my torrent
  client. It can be quite shit at times, but it's still my favorite option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst">dunst</a> for
  notifications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I might update this post another time going more in depth about my vim config.</p>
