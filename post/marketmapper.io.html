<h2>Recap of 2023</h2>
<p>This year was interesting and very busy. I would say I officially started my journey in cybersecurity.
In May, I attended the web hacking fundamentals training at 0xCC(5th - 6th) and won a HTB sub for coming top 3 in the CTF.
In September, I attended my first BSides conference in Melbourne. Really nice to meet a lot of familiar faces as well as some new folks I’ve never met. 
Is it just me but I feel being half the age of most of the people at conferences makes the atmosphere a bit “different”. 
</p>
<p> Also did my first internship (Aug - Oct) and now working full-time though of course I'm on my probation rn till Jan.  
</p>
<h2>Personal Goals</h2>
<p>As long as I'm improving and comparing with myself, I'm happy.
[1] Learn cryptography seriously. I not the most fond of math, but hey, it's vital for the subjects I want to learn.
  Even from a newbie perspective, cryptography is really amazing and once you get down to the theoretical rabbit hole, you get eaten alive.
[2] Digital signal and image processing are also on my list of "fields" to learn.
[3] Get good at solving stego and crypto challs.
[4] Come top 20 in Minetest CTF (not the cyber CTFs btw).</p>
  
<p>This year there has been a huge transition to blockchain technologies and it will be going that way moving forward.</p>
<p>Thinking of creating a Path to Competence
learning log because why not. It's good to keep a track of one's progress in life. 
  
<h2>Misc</h2>
<p>Moved to the countryside because why not. You literally have kangaroos next door, no kidding.
It's definitely not something you would see in a typical suburb.</p>
