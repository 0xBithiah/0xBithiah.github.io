<h2>Education</h2>
<p>Over the past few years, there's be a more positive light surrounding alternative education such as homeschooling and online schooling. 
</p>
<p> Now I personally attend an American online high school (TTU K-12) that's in fact run by Texas Tech University. Instead of going to a public or private secondary school
like all of my friends in grade 7, I took a bizarre choice to do online schooling. Initially, it was so that I could pursue fencing competitively and travel around the world. 
Covid unforunately hit and everything crumbled (going abroad, etc.). But personally I found the American schooling system to be better than the Australian system and decided to stick with it.

</p>
<h2>Reasons</h2>
<p>First of all, online schooling is different from homeschooling. I'm not a fan of homeschooling as that means your parents are your teachers...which kind of sucks for you and your parents (unless it's for some actual reason).
I have actual Texas state approved teachers who have office hours and give lessons, just like a normal school but online.</p>

<p>[1] You get the whole American package: I'm talking about doing the SAT/ACT and PSAT. Participating in US high school only competitions in programming, etc. Did I tell you can do AP classes?</p>

<p>[2] Material you learn: Honestly, understanding American culture, history, etc. is very vital in understanding the 21st century itself. A huge part of global finance/politics happens in Washington, D.C.

<p>[3] Teachers: I don't know what is so special about Texan teachers but they love what they do the most, teaching. You can feel the energy and effort in anything they teach. </p>

<p>[4] Flexibility: This is an understatement. Without the flexibility of online schooling, I wouldn't be able to accomplish what I have accomplished so far.</p>

<p>Can't list all of the advantages but the above are some of them. There isn't exactly anything wrong with the Australian education system but being physically in Australia, I can only attend a school physically. Unfortunately, Haileybury Pangea wasn't created in 2019.
I might've chosen to attend Haileybury Pangea instead. But I take what first comes my way.</p>

<p>From a young age, I hate being constricted by something whether it be school or society. I loved (and still love) sports and I assume my rebellious energy came from it.</p>
  
<h2>Options</h2>
<p>Many have asked me whether there are online schools? There are several reputable ones such as (1) Texas Tech University K-12, (2) Standford Online High School, (3) UT High School, and if you're in Australia (specifically Victoria) you have Haileybury Pangea.
</p>
<p>Is online schooling right for an individual? Most likely (95%) no. Just no. Everyone is different and I believe everyone should have education tailored to <b>them</b>. The beauty of online schooling is your whoe environment is tailored to you.</p>.
